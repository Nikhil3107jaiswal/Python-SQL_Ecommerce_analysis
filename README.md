# 🛒 E-commerce Sales Analysis with SQL + Python

Welcome to my E-commerce Sales Analysis project! This notebook combines the power of **SQL** for data querying and **Python** for data manipulation and visualization. It's a hands-on exploration of how sales data can reveal business insights over time.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

This project answers key questions like:

- 📅 How do monthly sales trend across years?
- 📈 What is the **cumulative sales** trajectory month by month?
- 🔁 How is the **Year-over-Year (YoY) growth** looking?

By writing SQL queries and visualizing the results in Python, I turned raw transactional data into clear, actionable insights.
